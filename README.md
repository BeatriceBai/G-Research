## The Cryptocurrency Market

Cryptocurrencies have become an extremely popular and volatile market, delivering massive returns (as well as losses) to investors. Thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created with a few major ones that many of you will have heard of including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or Dogecoin (DOGE).

Cryptocurrencies are traded extensively across crypto-exchanges, with an average volume of $41 billion traded daily over the last year, according to CryptoCompare (as of 25th July 2021). 

**Changes in prices between different cryptocurrencies are highly interconnected**. For example, Bitcoin has historically been a major driver of price changes across cryptocurrencies but other coins also impact the market.
